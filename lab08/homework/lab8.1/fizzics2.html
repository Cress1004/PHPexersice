    <H2>Turning Gold into Lead</H2>
    In a startling breakthrough, scientist B.O. "Gus" Fizzics has
    invented a <STRONG>practical</STRONG> technique for transmutation!
    For more details, please see <A HREF="give-us-your-gold.html">our
        transmutation thesis</A>.
    <H2>Perpetual Inactivity Machine</H2>
    In a radical approach that turned traditional attempts to develop
    perpetual motion machines on their heads, Prof. Fizzics has
    developed a verified, bona fide perpetual inaction machine. To
    purchase your own for only $99.00 (plus $43.29 shipping and
